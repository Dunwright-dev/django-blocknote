Overview
========

This documentation is organized using the `Di√°taxis framework <https://diataxis.fr/>`_, 
which divides documentation into four distinct types:

* **Tutorials** - Learning-oriented lessons that guide you through a series of steps
* **How-to Guides** - Problem-oriented directions that show you how to solve specific issues
* **Reference** - Information-oriented technical descriptions of the machinery and how to operate it
* **Explanation** - Understanding-oriented discussions that clarify and illuminate topics
